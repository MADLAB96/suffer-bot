 - [ ] Twitch integration (bot re-write)
    - [x] To make commands generic (Twitch, discord, etc.)
    - [ ] Remove Commando, replace with generic class system so commands can be for both Twitch and Discord (or any other).
    - [ ] Modular commands (Discord(A,B,C), Twitch(A, C, D)) given commands A, B, C, D
    - [x] distinguish Commands and Responses      
      - My main critism of Commando. Simple text responses are commands.
 - [ ] Database integration. (mongo lite?? if exists otherwise do sqlite idc)
    - [ ] basic metrics 
    - [ ] "API" using commands to add/remove/update stored responces
      - Could start this before the DB is up by pointing to local storage
