## Todo
 - more commands
    - [ ] urban dictionary
    - [ ] lunch command

    - [x] To make commands generic (Twitch, discord, etc.)
    - [x] Remove Commando, replace with generic class system so commands can be for both Twitch and Discord (or any other).
    - [x] Modular commands (Discord(A,B,C), Twitch(A, C, D)) given commands A, B, C, D
    - [x] distinguish Commands and Responses      
      - My main critism of Commando. Simple text responses are commands.

   - [ ]  One to many global aliases
   - [ ]  Trivia??? 
     - it kinda sucks, needs new API if its to be added back
