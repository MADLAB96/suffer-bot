### Suffer-Bot

barebones discord bot for personal use, will hopefully become something useful one day. *but not likely*

* prerequisites: discord account
* will have to get your own auth token from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
* I followed this to get started https://medium.com/davao-js/tutorial-creating-a-simple-discord-bot-9465a2764dc0 most of it is outdated though

#### Install and run
* install node.js & npm latest
`npm install`
`npm start`
